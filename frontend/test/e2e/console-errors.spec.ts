/**
 * Every authenticated route loads with an empty console, as an Admin and as a
 * User. The smoke suite checks the login page; these are the pages that decode
 * API bodies and could trip the error boundary, so a contract that
 * drifted between the backend and the SPA shows up here as a console error or
 * an alert before it shows up as a wrong screen.
 *
 * In the `routes` project, after every project whose specs create and delete
 * connectors: Accounts reads each listed connector's tokens, and one deleted
 * between the listing and that read would show an alert here that is no
 * fault of the route. It runs ahead of `guest`, whose sign-in as the seeded
 * Admin ends the session `admin.json` replays; no project signs in as `guest`,
 * so `user.json` replays a live session here too.
